# Reproducible-Research_Project

This project aims to reproduce [Credit Scoring Algorithm](https://www.kaggle.com/code/willianleite/credit-scoring-algorithm) by Willian Trindade Leite and Gui Gui.

# Organization
The work is split into two parts, each with its own Jupyter notebook:

1. [K-Nearest Neighbor Analysis]([https://github.com/elgunismayil0v/Reproducible-Research_Project/blob/main/notebooks/KNN.ipynb]).

2. [Logistic Regression]([https://github.com/elgunismayil0v/Reproducible-Research_Project/blob/main/notebooks/Logistic%20regresion.ipynb]).

# Data
We use [German Credit Data]([https://github.com/elgunismayil0v/Reproducible-Research_Project/blob/main/data/Credit.csv]) published by Professor Dr. Hans Hofmann.

# Requirements
Reproducing our work requires Python and packages.

# Team members
